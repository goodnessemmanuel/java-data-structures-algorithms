/**
 *The appeal of a string is the number of distinct characters found in the string.
 * For example, the appeal of "abbca" is 3 because it has 3 distinct characters: 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
 * Given a string s, return the total appeal of all of its substrings.
 * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
 * Input: s = "abbca"
 * Output: 28
 * Explanation: The following are the substrings of "abbca":
 * - Substrings of length 1: "a", "b", "b", "c", "a" have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 5.
 * - Substrings of length 2: "ab", "bb", "bc", "ca" have an appeal of 2, 1, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 7.
 * - Substrings of length 3: "abb", "bbc", "bca" have an appeal of 2, 2, and 3 respectively. The sum is 7.
 * - Substrings of length 4: "abbc", "bbca" have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6.
 * - Substrings of length 5: "abbca" has an appeal of 3. The sum is 3.
 * The total sum is 5 + 7 + 7 + 6 + 3 = 28.
 *
 * Input: s = "code"
 * Output: 20
 * Explanation: The following are the substrings of "code":
 * - Substrings of length 1: "c", "o", "d", "e" have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 4.
 * - Substrings of length 2: "co", "od", "de" have an appeal of 2, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 6.
 * - Substrings of length 3: "cod", "ode" have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6.
 * - Substrings of length 4: "code" has an appeal of 4. The sum is 4.
 * The total sum is 4 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 20

     * Building the Logic ü§î
     *
     * These type questions follow a similar pattern.
     * In questions where you are asked to count something in every substring / subarray of a 'N' size array / string having N = 10^5 . Then dont even try to generate all possible substrings/subarrays as it would definitely lead to TLE (i.e. Time Limit Exceeded).
     * What we can do ::: Just See How much contribution every element can provide to the answer in just one For Loop üëâüèª O(N)
     *
     * üìå Explanation ‚úçüèª
     *
     * Consider string "bcde"
     *
     * üéØ lets talk about character 'c' that in how many substrings this 'c' will be counted as unique string
     * ::: left no of characters on L.H.S of 'c' = left
     * ::: left no of characters on R.H.S of 'c' = right
     * Then total possible substrings containing this 'c' = (left+1) x (right+1)
     *
     * Thus contributions for c = 2 * 3 = 6
     * and those 6 substrings are ( bc, bcd, bcde, c, cd, cde )
     *
     * So we can say that every character will have contribution of (left+1)x(right+1) to the ans.
     *
     * üéØ But there is one small catch here !
     * What if characters are same ?? then only one of those characters will have contribution in any substring containing them.
     * "acca"
     * Here first 'c' will for sure have a contribution = (left+1)x(right+1) = 2 x 3 = 6
     * but for second 'c' Left region will be reduced till the rightmost 'c' on leftside. So the value of left for second 'c' will be = 0 !!
     * Right will have no change.
     * So contribution for second 'c' = 1 x 2 = 2;
     *
     * This way we can calculate the contribution for each and every character in just one for loop.
     *
     * ‚úÖ Time Complexity = O(N)
     * ‚úÖ Space Complexity = O(26) = O(1)
